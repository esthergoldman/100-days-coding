# Exercise 1
## Average Height

You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

**Important** You should not use the `sum()` or `len()` functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

# Exercise 2
## Average Height

You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.
Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions.

**Important**  you are not allowed to use the max or min functions.

# Exercise 3
## Adding Evens

You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

# Exercise 4
## FizzBuzz

You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

`When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".` 

`And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz".`
